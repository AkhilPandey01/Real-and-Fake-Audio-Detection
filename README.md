# Real and Fake Audio Detection

![Banner](path_to_banner_image)  
*Leveraging Chaotic Theory and Deep Learning to Detect Fake Audio.*

---

## Overview

Fake audio detection has become a critical need in the digital age. This project aims to differentiate between real and fake audio using **chaotic theory** and **deep learning models**.

### Key Features
- **Dataset:** 13,000 audio samples:
  - 8,000 human sounds.
  - 2,000 environmental sounds.
  - 3,000 machine-generated sounds.
- **Applications:** Digital forensics, media verification, and secure communication.

## Workflow Overview

Hereâ€™s how the system operates:

![Workflow](path_to_workflow_diagram_image)

1. **Data Collection**: Gather real and fake audio samples across languages and environments.
2. **Preprocessing**: Normalize, denoise, and extract features (e.g., MFCCs, spectrograms, and chaotic attractors).
3. **Model Training**: Train deep learning models to analyze subtle differences.
4. **Evaluation**: Validate using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Data Preprocessing

![Spectrogram Example](path_to_spectrogram_image)  
*Visualizing audio patterns through spectrograms.*

### Steps in Preprocessing:
1. **Normalization**: Ensures consistent audio levels.
2. **Noise Reduction**: Removes unwanted noise for clarity.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes MFCCs and chaotic attractors to capture subtle distinctions.

### Preprocessing Code:
```python
import librosa
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def preprocess_audio(file_path):
    """
    Load audio, extract MFCC features, and scale data.
    """
    audio, sr = librosa.load(file_path, sr=16000)
    mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(audio, sr=sr, n_mfcc=40)
    return StandardScaler().fit_transform(mfcc.T)
```

## Models Used

We explored multiple deep learning architectures:

| **Model**        | **Strengths**                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LKCNN**         | Optimized for real-time applications with low latency.                      |
| **ResNet**        | Excels at capturing complex audio patterns with deep feature hierarchies.   |
| **Inception Net** | Multi-scale feature analysis for nuanced detection.                        |
| **Res-TSSDNet**   | High spatial and temporal accuracy.                                         |
| **Shallow Net**   | Lightweight, suitable for small datasets.                                  |
| **MLP**           | Effective for simpler datasets.                                             |

## Model Implementation

### Lightweight CNN (LKCNN)
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

def build_lkcnn(input_shape):
    """
    Build and compile a Lightweight CNN model.
    """
    model = Sequential([
        Conv1D(32, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
        Conv1D(64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu'),
        MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2),
        Flatten(),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary classification
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
```

## Results

### Key Findings:
- **LKCNN** and **ResNet** demonstrated the highest accuracy for complex datasets.
- **Inception Net** provided detailed feature hierarchies but required higher computational resources.

| **Metric**    | **Value**   |
|---------------|-------------|
| Accuracy      | 94.5%       |
| Precision     | 93.8%       |
| Recall        | 92.3%       |
| F1 Score      | 93.0%       |
